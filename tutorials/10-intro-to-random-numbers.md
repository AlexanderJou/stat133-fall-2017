Random Numebrs
--------------

Random numbers have many applications in science and computer programming, especially when there are significant uncertainties in a phenomenon of interest. In this tutorial we'll look at some practical problems that involve working with random numbers and creating simulations.

The key idea in computer simulations with random numbers is first to formulate an algorithmic description of the phenomenon we want to study. This description frequently maps directly onto a simple R script, where we use random numbers to mimic the uncertain features of the phenomenon. The script needs to perform a large number of repeated calculations, and the final answers are only approximate, but the accuracy can usually be made good enough for practical purposes.

Generating Random Numbers
=========================

R has several functions that allows you to generate random numbers following a certain distribution.

The function `sample()` takes a random sample from the input vector.

All computations of random numbers are based on deterministic algorithms, so the sequence of numbers is not truly random. However, the sequence of numbers appears to lack any systematic pattern, and we can therefore regard the numbers as random.

The Seed
--------

Every time you use one of the random generator functions in R, the call produces different numbers. For replication and debugging purposes, it is useful to get the same sequence of random numebrs every time we run the script. This functionality is obtained by setting a **seed** before we start generating the numebrs. The seed is an integer and set by the function `set.seed()`

``` r
set.seed(123)
runif(4)
```

    ## [1] 0.2875775 0.7883051 0.4089769 0.8830174

If we set the seed to `123` again, the sequence of uniform random numbers is regenerated:

``` r
set.seed(123)
runif(4)
```

    ## [1] 0.2875775 0.7883051 0.4089769 0.8830174

If we don't specify a seed, the random generator functions set a seed based on the current time. That is, the seed will be different each time we run the script and consequently the sequence of random numbers will also be different.

Uniformly Distributed Random Numebrs
====================================

The numbers generated by `runif()` tend to be equally distributed between 0 and 1, which means that there is no part of the interval \[0, 1\] with more random numbers than other parts.

``` r
set.seed(345)
n <- 500
x <- 1:n
y <- runif(n, min = -1, max = 1)

plot(x, y, las = 1, pch = 19, col = "#88888855")
```

The previous figure shows the values of 500 random uniformly distributed numbers between -1 and 1. Another interesting visualization involves looking at how the random numbers are distributed in the given interval.

``` r
hist(y, las = 1, col = "gray80")
```

Drawing Integers
----------------

To simulate drawing random integers, you can use the function `sample.int()`. The main argument is `n`, which represents the maximum integer to sample from: `1, 2, 3, ..., n`

``` r
sample.int(10)
```

Computing Probabilities
=======================

With the mathematical rules from probability theory we can compute the probability that a certain event happens, say the probability that you get one blue ball when drawing three balls from a box with four blue balls, five white balls, and three yellow balls. Unfortunately, theoretical calculations of probabilities may soon become hard or impossible if the problem is slightly changed. There is a simple numerical way of computing probabilities that is generally applicable to problems with uncertainty: Monte Carlo Simulation.

Principles of Monte Carlo Simulation
------------------------------------

Assume that we perform *N* experiments where the outcome of each experiment is random. Suppose that some event takes place *M* times in these *N* experiments. An estimate of the probability of the event is then *M*/*N*. The estimate becomes more accurate as *N* increases, and the exact probability is assumed to be reached in the limit as *N* → ∞.

Programs that run a large number of experiments and record the outcome of events are often called simulation programs. The mathematical technique of letting the computer perform lots of experiments based on drawing random numbers is commonly called **Monte Carlo simulation**. Many probabilistic problems can be calculated exactly by mathematics from probability theory, but very often Monte Carlo simulation is the only way to solve statistical problems.

Example: Drawing balls from a box
---------------------------------

Suppose there are 11 balls in a box: four blue, five white, and three yellow. We want to write R code that draws three balls at random without replacement from the box, and compute the probability of drawing two or more blue balls.

``` r
# colored balls in a box
box <- c(rep('blue', 4), rep('white', 5), rep('yellow', 3))
box
```

    ##  [1] "blue"   "blue"   "blue"   "blue"   "white"  "white"  "white" 
    ##  [8] "white"  "white"  "yellow" "yellow" "yellow"

``` r
# drawing three balls without replacement
sample(box, 3)
```

    ## [1] "blue" "blue" "blue"

In this example you can apply the probability rules to find the probability of getting at least two blue balls from drawing three balls out of the box. But let's see how to use Monte Carlo simulation to find an approximate value for such probability. We are going to simulate 1000 repetitions of the experiment. Each repetition involves drawing three balls. To store the outputs we can use a matrix of 1000 rows and three columns:

``` r
# number of balls drawn, and repetitions
draw <- 3
reps <- 1000

outputs <- matrix("", nrow = reps, ncol = draw)
set.seed(123)
for (i in 1:reps) {
  outputs[i,] <- sample(box, draw)
}
head(outputs)
```

    ##      [,1]     [,2]     [,3]   
    ## [1,] "blue"   "white"  "white"
    ## [2,] "yellow" "yellow" "blue" 
    ## [3,] "white"  "yellow" "white"
    ## [4,] "white"  "yellow" "white"
    ## [5,] "white"  "white"  "blue" 
    ## [6,] "yellow" "blue"   "blue"

Now that we have our 1000 repetitions, let's compute the number of blue balls for each row in `outputs`:

``` r
# number of blue balls in each experiment
blues <- apply(outputs, 1, function(x) sum(x == "blue"))

# number of at least two blue balls
sum(blues >= 2)
```

    ## [1] 241

``` r
# approx probability of two or more blue balls
sum(blues >= 2) / reps
```

    ## [1] 0.241
