## Simple Math Functions

Consider the following mathematical functions:

- $f(x) = x^2$
- $g(x) = 2x + 5$

Write two functions `f()` and `g()` based on the previous equations.

```{r}
# your function f()

```

```{r}
# your function g()

```

\bigskip

Test your functions with:

```r
f(2)
f(-5)

g(0)
g(-5/2)
```

Write code to create the following composite functions:

- `fog()` for the composite function: $f \circ g(x)$
- `gof()` for the composite function: $g \circ f(x)$

```{r}
# your function fog()

```

```{r}
# your function gof()

```

Test your composite functions with:

```r
fog(2)
fog(-5)

gof(0)
gof(-5/2)
```

## Pythagoras

The pythagoras formula is used to compute the length of the hypotenuse, $c$, of 
a right triangle with legs of length $a$ and $b$.

![hypotenuse](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/5fd521cee81d583ce94bf6710984cc2a9eb7c3da)

Write a function `pythagoras()` that takes two arguments `a` and `b`, and 
returns the length of the hypotenuse:

```{r}
# your pythagoras() function

```

Test your `pythagoras()` with two leg values: `pythagoras(3, 4)`

```{r}
# your test

```

Modify your function `pythagoras()` so that argument `b` takes the same value of argument `a`. Test it with just one leg value: `pythagoras(5)`

```{r}
# your test

```

## Unit Conversion Formulas

The following exercises involve writing simple functions to convert from one 
type of unit to other.


### Miles to Kilometers

Write a function `miles2kms()` that converts miles into kilometers: 1 mile
is equal to 1.6 kilometers. Give the argument a default value of 1.

```{r}
miles2kms <- function() {
  # fill in
}
```

Use `miles2kms()` to obtain mile conversions, in order to create a table 
(i.e. data frame) like the one below. The first ten rows range from 1 to 10 miles, 
and then from 10 to 100 in 10 mile steps. The second column corresponds to kms.

| miles | kms |
|-------|-----|
|   1   | 1.6 |
|   2   | 3.2 |
|  ...  | ... |
|  10   | 16  |
|  20   | 32  |
|  ...  | ... |
| 100   | 160 |


### Gallons to Liters, and viceversa

Write a function `gallon2liters()` that converts gallons to liters: 1 gallon
is equal to 3.78541 liters:

```{r}
# your gallons2liters() function

```

Use `gallon2liters()` to make an inverse function `liters2gallons()`.

```{r}
# your liters2gallons() function

```

Use `liters2gallons()` to obtain liter conversions, in order to create a table 
(i.e. data frame) like the one below. The first ten rows range from 1 to 10 liters, 
and then from 10 to 100 in 10 liter steps. The second column corresponds to gallons.

| liters | gallons   |
|--------|-----------|
|   1    | 0.2641722 |
|   2    | 0.5283444 |
|  ...   | ...       |
|  10    | 2.6417218 |
|  20    | 5.283444  |
|  ...   | ...       |
| 100    | 26.417218 |



### Seconds to Years

According to Wikipedia, in 2015 the life expectancy of a person born in the US 
was 79 years. Consider the following question: Can a newborn baby in USA expect 
to live for one billion ($10^9$) seconds? 

To answer this question, write a function `seconds2years()` that takes
a number in seconds and returns the equivalent number of years.
Test the function with `seconds2years(1000000000)`

```{r}
# your code

```

## Gaussian Function

The Gaussian (Normal) function, given in the equation below, is one of the 
most widely used functions in science and statistics:

![gaussian function](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/8aa9ff808602c27f1d9d63d7b2c115388a34f190)

The parameters $\sigma$ and $\mu$ are real numbers, where $\sigma$ must be greater than 
zero. 

Make a function `gaussian()` that takes three arguments: `x`, `m`, and `s`. 
Evaluate the function with $m = 0$, $s = 2$, and $x = 1$.

```{r}
# your code

```

Test your `gaussian()` function and compare it with the R function `dnorm()`

```{r}
# compare with dnorm()
dnorm(x = 1, mean = 0, sd = 2)
```

Now try `gaussian()` with a vector `seq(-4.5, 4.5, by = 0.1)`, and pass the values
to `plot()` to get a normal curve. Here's code with values obtained from `dnorm()`

```{r}
# you should get a plot like this one
x_values <- seq(-4.5, 4.5, by = 0.1)
y_values <- dnorm(x_values, mean = 0, sd = 2)
plot(x_values, y_values, las = 1, type = "l", lwd = 2)
```

Your turn:

```{r}
# your code
```

### Polynomials

In this problem we want to see whether the graph of a given polynomial
will cross or touch the _x_ axis in a given interval. 

Let's begin with the polynomial: $f(x) = x^2 (x - 1)$. The first thing 
to do is write a function for the polynomial, for instance:

```{r}
poly1 <- function(x) {
  (x^2) * (x - 1)
}
```

Once you have a function for the polynomial, you can create a set of pairs of
points $x$ and $y = f(x)$, and then use them to graph the polynomial

```{r}
# set of points
x <- seq(-4, 4, length.out = 20)
y <- poly1(x)

# graph polynomial
plot(x, y, type = 'l', lwd = 3, col = "#FB7215", las = 1)
abline(h = 0, v = 0, col = '#888888aa', lwd = 1.5)
title(main = expression(paste(f(x), ' = ', x^2, (x - 1))))
```

Write functions and graph the following polynomials in the x-axis interval
-4 to 4:

a. $f(x) = x^3$ 
b. $f(x) = (x^2 - 1)(x + 3)^3$
c. $f(x) = (x^2 - 1)(x^2 - 9)$

## Descriptive Statistics

Write a function `descriptive()` that takes a numeric vector as input, and 
returns a named vector with the following descriptive statistics:

- `min`: minimum
- `q1`: first quartile (Q2)
- `median`: median
- `mean`: mean
- `q3`: third quartile (Q3)
- `max`: maximum
- `range`: range or span (max - min)
- `iqr`: interquartile range (IQR)
- `sd`: standard deviation

```{r}
# your descriptive() function
descriptive <- function() {
  # fill in

}
```
